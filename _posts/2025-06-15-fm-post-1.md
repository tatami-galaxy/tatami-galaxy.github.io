My understanding of continuous Flow Matching :)

Flow matching gives us a way to model complex real world distributions (target) from simpler or known distrubitions (source). One way to visualize this is in the form of fluid flow from source to target distributions in $$d$$ dimensional Euclidean space, where the fluid is essentially probability mass. We can define a time dependent velocity field in this space which characterizes the flow. Then, converting samples from the source distribution to the target distribution can be thought of as transporting probability mass to convert one density into another along the given velocity field. 

For now, let's limit ourselves to continuous distributions or densities. We can think of the flow as transporting probability mass over time $$t$$, where $$t$$ is real and varies from $$t \rightarrow [0,1]$$. Let the random variable corresponding to the density at time $$t$$ be given by $$X_t$$. Let $$p$$ and $$q$$ be the source and target densities respectively. Therefore $$X_0 \sim p$$ and $$X_1 \sim q$$ are the corresponding random variables. Then, the goal is to convert samples $$X_0 = x_0$$ into samples $$X_1 = x_1$$.

Let $$u : [0,1] \times R^d \rightarrow R^d$$ be the time dependent velocity field. This gives rise to the following ODE : 

$$u_t(x) = \frac{dx}{dt}, \tag{1}$$ 

where $$x$$ is a point in $$R^d$$. Let $$\psi_t(x)$$ be a solution to (1) with initial condition $$\psi_0(x) = x$$. That is, $$\psi_t(x)$$ gives $$x$$ at time $$t$$ after being transported along the velocity field. This is termed as the flow corresponding to the velocity field $$u$$. We will see shortly when such a flow exists and whether it's unique. 

Since we are interested in transporting probability densities, we need to apply the flow $$\psi_t$$ to the random variables we've defined above. This gives us :

$$X_t = \psi_t(X_0), \quad t \in [0,1], \quad X_0 \sim p \tag{2}$$
